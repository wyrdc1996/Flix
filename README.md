### Notes
When I worked on the first bonus user story, I just create a show segue action from the movie grid cell to the same new view controller I used for the movie table cell. I am not sure is it the right approach, or I should create a new view controller for this task, but it works fine for now.

### Notes
Needed to spend more time on the poster image because of wrong base_url was pasted, but overall part 1 is pretty easy to complete.
